- work at:
  - linear regime: standard perturbation theory (SPT) to k~0.1/Mpc 
  - mild non-linear regime: SPT breaks down , EFT goes to k~0.5/Mpc for CDM , k~0.2/Mpc for galaxies. 
- how it works: set a cutoff scale $\Lambda$ to separate the linear and non-linear regime, where $\delta$ is too large and pertubation theory breaks down. Describe all small scale things with  $\sigma_{ij}$, some terms with coefficients which to be determined by data (simulation or observations).
